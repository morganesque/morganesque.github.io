/*
    This is a really useful mixin for using a background image but 
    enforcing the aspect ratio so that you don't need to specify a
    height and therefore fix it for mobile views.
    
    This mixin also allows you to specify a large and small version 
    of the ratio which means the image can have a different ratio at 
    mobile sizes (meaning you don't take up ridiculous heights on mobile).
    
    So the first couple of values defines the image ratio at one width, 
    the second defines it at another, the mixin does the maths to make 
    this happen.
