<p>This was a large internal project with a lot of stakeholders and participants. Working with a large group of talented designers and an excellent project manager I was responsible for the interaction design and a large proportion of the front-end development. The brief was to provide  a bang-up-to-date design which would really capture the range of activities W&amp;P engage in whilst conveying both the personality and the unique approach of the company. We went with a responsive design using a masonry-style grid to enable us to deploy the website quickly and easily update it over the following months.</p>
