<p>This is a fantastic idea. It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hackney-hear-london-fields/id497510075?mt=8">iPhone app</a> which tracks where you walk and then plays you different audio depending on where you go. It does augmented reality in a way which is truly engaging and allows you to explore a place in a completely new way. The guys at <a href="http://www.amblr.net/">Amblr</a> already had most of the functionality working but needed some help with the interface design on a couple of versions of the app they were currently working on. I did some screen design and defined some of the elements of the UI to make sure the app made sense and was as simple as possible to use.</p>
