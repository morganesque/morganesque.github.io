<p>Hello, I'm Tom Morgan. This was my website.</p>
<p>From November 2010 to April 2015 I worked as a freelance Interaction Designer and Front-end Developer and I used <a href="https://morganesque.com/is/tom/morgan/">morganesque.com</a> for self-promotion.</p>
<p>During this time I took on projects where a website (or a web based application) needed to be designed and where the output of the design process was expected to be a working site in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Then in 2015 I took a job as an Interaction Designer in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">UK Government</a>, but I left this website here as a record of that time and some of the work I did.</p>
<p>If you're interested in what I've done since, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsmorgan/">have a look on Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button" href="/is/tom/morgan">View the website</a></p>
<p>Good luck. Cheers, bye!</p>
