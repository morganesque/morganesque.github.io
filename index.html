<p style="margin-top:1em">Hello</p>
<p>From November 2010 to April 2015 I worked as a freelance Interaction Designer and Front-end Developer, taking on projects where a website or web based application needed to be designed and where the output of that design process is expected to be a working site in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I used this website for self-promotion during that time, until I took a job as an Interaction Designer at DWP.</p>
<p>I've left it here as a record of that time and some of the work I did.</p>
<p>If you're interested in what I've done since, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsmorgan/">have a look on Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="/is/tom/morgan">carry onto to the website</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers, bye!</p>
